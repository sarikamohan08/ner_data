You are a structured data extraction assistant.

Your task is to extract a table from the following healthcare reimbursement policy text. The extracted table should have the following columns:

| service_type | service_desc | services | codes | rev code | drg code | cpt code | hcpcs code | reimbursement amt | reimbursement rate | reimbursement methodology | health benefit plans |

Follow these rules:
- **service_type**: Determine whether the service is INPATIENT, OUTPATIENT, or another category mentioned in the text.
- **service_desc**: A brief, contextual description of the policy or grouping (e.g., “level 2”, “covered services not listed”).
- **services**: Extract the specific service being referenced (e.g., "Drugs & Biologicals", "level 1", "all other services").
- **codes**: Extract any codes like fee schedule codes (e.g., 005-489, 201-544).
- **rev code**: Extract revenue codes if listed (e.g., 191, 192, 193).
- **drg code**, **cpt code**, **hcpcs code**: Set to 0 unless explicitly mentioned.
- **reimbursement amt**: If there's a flat dollar payment (e.g., "$395"), convert to a numeric value (e.g., 395).
- **reimbursement rate**: If a percentage is mentioned (e.g., 70%, 50%, 100%), extract the number only (e.g., 70).
- **reimbursement methodology**: Use keywords like "fee schedule", "usual and customary", "Medicaid allowable", etc.
- **health benefit plans**: Include payer or plan names if mentioned (e.g., Humana, Medicare); otherwise, leave blank.

Output the result as a markdown table. Be precise and exhaustive.
