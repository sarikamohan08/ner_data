Developed a Python program to process a PDF containing Excel-based data.  

### Approach:  
1. **Extracting Content:**  
   - Used **PyMuPDF4llm** to convert the PDF into markdown format and Excel, as it provides better text extraction for **HCA-type** documents.  

2. **Excel File Creation & Transformation:**  
   - Generated an Excel file with multiple sheets to transform the data and output the desired table format.  

3. **Row-wise Transformation:**  
   - Extracted relevant data for each row.  
   - Split **coding/def** values by "AND" and repeated rows for each coding value.  
   - Repeated rows for each provider (**Poinciana Hospital, Putnam Hospital, and Osceola Hospital**).  
   - Constructed the final DataFrame by appending each transformed row to a list and converting it into a DataFrame.  

### Challenges & Solutions:  

#### 1. **Dynamic Provider Name Detection:**  
   - Since there are multiple provider names, the code was adjusted to automatically detect provider columns in the input data.  

#### 2. **Dynamic Header Row Detection:**  
   - Implemented the **`find_header_row`** function to scan each row in a sheet and locate the row containing the **"coding/def"** keyword, ensuring adaptability to varying input formats.  

#### 3. **Dynamic Provider Column Identification:**  
   - Automatically identified provider columns as those appearing after the **"coding/def"** column, allowing flexibility in column placement across sheets.  

#### 4. **Handling Multiple Coding Definitions:**  
   - Split the **"coding/def"** column values on commas and generated separate rows for each coding definition.  

#### 5. **Regex for Extracting Amounts & Percentages:**  
   - Extracted **dollar amounts** (`\$[\d,]+`) and **percentages** (`\d+%`) from provider column values, ensuring structured financial data extraction.  

#### 6. **Separation of MS-DRG, Rev Code, CPT, ICD9/ICD10, and HCPCS Codes:**  
   - Created **five rows** for each combination when **CPT, ICD9/ICD10, and HCPCS** codes were present, marking them distinctly with an **(X)**.  

#### 7. **Multi-Sheet Processing:**  
   - Iterated over all sheets, processed each, and combined the transformed data into a single DataFrame.  

#### 8. **Detecting Service Type (Inpatient or Outpatient):**  
   - Looped through DataFrame rows to detect **"Inpatient structure"** and **"Outpatient structure"** keywords.  
   - Assigned **service_type** dynamically:  
     - If **"Inpatient structure"** was found, all subsequent rows were marked as **Inpatient** until **"Outpatient structure"** appeared.  
     - If **"Outpatient structure"** was found, all subsequent rows were marked as **Outpatient** until **"Inpatient structure"** appeared again.  
   - Solution:  
     - The **`extract_service_type_from_rows`** function properly tracked transitions between "Inpatient structure" and "Outpatient structure" based on surrounding rows.  

#### 9. **Handling Multiple Tax IDs & NPIs for Each Provider:**  
   - Since multiple providers exist, each with unique **Tax ID** and **NPI** values, the mapping was handled dynamically for every row.  
   - Approach:  
     - **Provider Name Lookup:**  
       - The **`fill_taxid_for_provider`** and **`fill_npi_for_provider`** functions retrieved the corresponding Tax ID and NPI for each provider.  
     - **Filling Tax IDs & NPIs:**  
       - When a provider name matched, the corresponding Tax ID and NPI were dynamically assigned.  

### Final Implementation:  
- To streamline the entire process, a **class-based structure** was developed specifically for **HCA-type** files.  
- The program:  
  1. **Identifies whether the file is HCA-type.**  
  2. **Converts the PDF into markdown and Excel.**  
  3. **Processes the extracted data seamlessly.**
