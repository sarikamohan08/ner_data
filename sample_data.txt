Extract "Provider Speciality" as TEXT exactly as written in the document.

This field may appear on cover pages, inside optional information boxes,
or anywhere in the contract. It may also appear as:

- “Provider Specialty”
- “Specialty”
- “Provider Type”
- “Facility Type”
- “Provider Service Category”

RULES:

1. ALWAYS extract the full text following these labels.
2. Preserve the original wording exactly as printed.
3. Do NOT convert this into an indicator or boolean. It must always be TEXT.
4. If multiple specialties are listed, join them as comma-separated text.
5. If the specialty appears only on the cover sheet, still extract it.
6. If the document contains **no provider specialty**, return an empty string (“”).
