You will receive a text containing various healthcare services levels and types, including "Skilled Nursing Facility Levels 1-4", "covered services", and "Inpatient/Outpatient services." If multiple PROVIDER_NAME, EFFECTIVE_FROM_DATE, NPI, or TAX_ID values occur in the document, add only the first occurrence for every record.

Scan all narrative text and tables for any service mention matching or including:
- "Covered Services rendered"
- "Covered Services not listed"
- "Covered Services provided"
- or similar phrases, including reimbursement percentages, codes, and methodologies.

For each service mention, extract and structure a record with the following fields:

- PROVIDER_NAME: provider's name (first occurrence in document)
- EFFECTIVE_FROM_DATE: effective date (first occurrence)
- NPI: provider NPI number (first occurrence)
- TAX_ID: provider tax id (first occurrence)

For each service, table, or narrative, extract (where present):

- SERVICE_TYPE: e.g., 'inpatient', 'outpatient', 'inpatient services', 'outpatient services'. If "inpatient part B" appears, set as "outpatient".
- SERVICE_DESC: any paragraph, row, or description below the service or associated with that service
- SERVICES: service levels, categories, or named service groupings (examples: 'Level 1', 'Level 2', 'Drugs & Biologicals', 'Covered Services rendered', 'Long term care days', 'SNF Level Services', etc.)
- REIMBURSEMENT_AMT: reimbursement in dollars (integer/string, e.g. "$2000"); otherwise blank
- REIMBURSEMENT_RATE: reimbursement percent (string, e.g. "65%")
- REIMBURSEMENT_METHODOLOGY: e.g. 'Per Diem', 'fee schedule', 'per procedure', 'Medicare allowable', etc. If "fee schedule" is mentioned, append its name/method.
- CODES: revenue code, fee schedule code, or any relevant code (only the actual code values, not strings)
- REVENUE_CD_IND: 1 if revenue code present, else 0
- DRG_CD_IND: 1 if MS-DRG code present, else 0
- CPT_IND: 1 if CPT code present, else 0
- HCPCS_IND: 1 if HCPCS code present, else 0
- ICD_CD_IND: 1 if ICD code present, else 0
- DIAGNOSIS_CD_IND: 1 if diagnosis code present, else 0
- MODIFIER_CD_IND: 1 if modifier code present, else 0
- LOB_IND: comma-separated lines of business ("Medicare", "Medicaid", "Commercial") present below skilled nursing or in table
- CASE_RATE: any mention of case rate with a duration, e.g. 'case rate for 30 days'; else blank
- GROUPER_IND: 1 if word 'grouper' present, else 0
- GROUPER: the value of any "grouper" column or mention, else blank
- APC_IND: 1 if 'APC' found, else 0
- EXCLUSION_IND: 1 if record relates to an exclusion, else 0
- MSR_IND: 1 if "Multiple Surgery Logic" mentioned, else 0
- BILETRAL_PROCEDURE_IND: 1 if "biletral procedures" in context, else 0
- EXCLUDE_FROM_TRANSFER_IND: 1 if a heading or section named "transfer" is present, else 0
- TRANSFER_CALCULATION: any "TRANSFER" calculation logic detailed in text
- EXCLUDE_FROM_STOPLOSS_IND: 1 if "stop loss threshold" found, else 0
- METHOD_OF_PAYMENT: code string as found (e.g. 'no1', 'po3'). Do NOT paraphrase or alter.
- HEALTH_BENEFIT_PLANS: value as found in table (or blank)
- ADDITIONAL_NOTES: any extra notes relating to this row, exception wording, limitations, or context from the extraction
- AGE_GROUP: 1 if "Age group" appears anywhere in service-related text/table, else 0
- PROVIDER_SPECIALITY: 1 if "provider speciality" appears in heading or record, else 0
- OTHER_FLAT_FEE: 1 if "flat fee" mentioned, else 0
- SURG_FLAT_FEE: 1 if "flat surg fee" or "surgical fee" mentions found, else 0
