===============================================================
### EXTRACTION LOGIC & SCOPE
===============================================================

- Each service row should include **only one service** (no grouping multiple unrelated items).
- Text relationships are local — treat nearby paragraphs, tables, or headings as part of the same record.
- If a heading like “Bilateral Procedures”, “Multiple Surgery Logic”, or “Provider Speciality” applies to multiple rows below, assign the indicator (and shared details) to all those rows.

===============================================================
### OUTPUT RULES
===============================================================

- Output only valid JSON array — no markdown or commentary.
- All numeric indicators must be strings: "1" or "0".
- Missing or irrelevant fields should be empty strings "".
- Include every row that contains any service, covered service, or reimbursement-related rate.
