### CIS TYPE DESCRIPTION (Service Category Mapping)
===================================================================

Populate "cis_type_description" based on keywords found in the service row, table row,
or surrounding paragraph. Determine the type using the following rules:

1) **SNF / Skilled Nursing**
Set "cis_type_description" = "SNF" if ANY of these appear:
    - "SNF"
    - "SNU"
    - "Skilled Nursing"
    - "Skilled Nursing Facility"
    - "Skilled Nursing Facilities"
    - "Level 1", "Level 2", "Level 3" (when associated with SNF context)
    - "Inpatient Nursing", “Nursing Facility”
Do NOT confuse with rehabilitation levels; use surrounding context.

2) **Rehabilitation**
Set "cis_type_description" = "Rehab" if ANY appear:
    - "Rehab"
    - "Rehabilitation"
    - "General Rehabilitation"
    - "Trauma Rehabilitation"
    - "Brain Injury Rehab"
    - "Spinal Cord Rehab"

3) **Audiology**
Set "cis_type_description" = "Audiology" if text contains:
    - "Audiology"
    - Audiology-specific V-codes such as V5008, V5010, V5020, V5240, etc.

4) **Cardiology**
Set "cis_type_description" = "Cardiology" if text contains:
    - "Cardiology"
    - "Outpatient Cardiology"
    - "Cardiac"
    - "Cardiac Services", "Cardiac Rehab" (cardiac rehab still maps to Cardiology)

5) **Detox**
Set "cis_type_description" = "Detox" if ANY appear:
    - "Detox"
    - "Detoxification"
    - "Substance Abuse / Detoxification"
    - "Inpatient Detox"

6) **Dialysis**
Set "cis_type_description" = "Dialysis" if ANY appear:
    - "Dialysis"
    - "Hemodialysis"
    - "Peritoneal Dialysis"
    - "Dialysis Services"

7) **Default Rule**
If none of the above categories match:
    - Leave "cis_type_description" = "" (blank).
    - Do NOT guess or fabricate a type.

8) MULTIPLE MATCHES
If multiple keywords appear, select the **most specific** category
(e.g., “Cardiac Rehab” → "Cardiology", not “Rehab”).
