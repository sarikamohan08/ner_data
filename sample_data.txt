- Always extract any line or paragraph containing these phrases as a separate service:
     - “Covered Services rendered”
     - “Covered Services provided”
     - “Covered Services not listed”
   - These must appear in the `Service` field.
   - The reimbursement information (rate, amount, or schedule) appearing anywhere in that paragraph (same or next sentence) must be linked to that service.
   - Example:
     > Covered Services rendered at 70% of  005–270 Fee Schedule
       → Service = "Covered Services rendered"
       → Reimbursement_Rate = "70%"
       → Code = "005–270 Fee Schedule"
       → Description = full sentence text
