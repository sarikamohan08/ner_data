### EFFECTIVE DATE INHERITANCE (REQUIRED)
===================================================================
- Every service row MUST contain an "Effective_Date" value.
- If a service row DOES NOT contain its own explicit Effective Date in the text,
  then inherit (copy) the most recent Provider-level Effective Date that appears
  earlier in the document or earlier in the chunk.
- NEVER create or guess new dates.
- NEVER modify or transform the date format.
- Valid sources for inherited Effective Date include:
    • Provider Effective Date
    • Facility Effective Date
    • Agreement Effective Date
- If NO provider-level effective date has appeared anywhere earlier,
  then leave "Effective_Date" as "".
- This rule applies to ALL services extracted from tables and paragraphs.
