### MULTIPLE SURGERY LOGIC (MSR) EXTRACTION (FINAL)
===================================================================

- **MSR_Ind**
  - Set `"MSR_Ind": "1"` if the heading, table, or paragraph includes any of the following terms:
    • "Multiple Surgery Logic"
    • "Primary Surgery Logic"
    • "Secondary Surgery Logic"
    • "Tertiary Surgery Logic"
    • "Multiple surgical procedures"
  - Otherwise set `"MSR_Ind": "0"`.

- **MSR_Type**
  - If the text or table specifies "Primary", "Secondary", or "Tertiary", capture it exactly.
  - If all tiers are described (Primary/Secondary/Tertiary), create **separate JSON records** for each with its specific rate.

- **Reimbursement_Rate**
  - Extract the numeric percentage value that applies to each surgical level (primary, secondary, tertiary).
  - Examples:
    - “Primary procedure shall be 100%” → `"Reimbursement_Rate": "100%"`
    - “Secondary procedure shall be fifty percent (50%)” → `"Reimbursement_Rate": "50%"`
    - “Third procedure shall be twenty-five percent (25%)” → `"Reimbursement_Rate": "25%"`
  - Always include the percent sign in extracted values.
  - If multiple percentages appear (100%, 50%, 25%), output separate JSON rows for each.
  - Do **not** include any wording like “of rates identified” in the rate field — only the numeric or percentage value.

- **Service**
  - If the section or header includes “Multiple Surgery Logic”, set `"Service": "Multiple Surgery Logic"`.
  - If nested under another category (e.g., “Outpatient Services”), you may append context: `"Outpatient – Multiple Surgery Logic"`.

- **Description**
  - Include the entire paragraph or table section describing payment logic for multiple surgeries, including all rate tiers and commercial applicability.

- **Table Extraction**
  - If multiple surgery logic appears as a table (e.g., “Procedure Level” vs “% of Payment”), extract each row with:
    - `"MSR_Type"` from “Procedure Level”
    - `"Reimbursement_Rate"` from “% of Payment”
    - `"MSR_Ind": "1"`
  - Each row becomes a distinct JSON record.
