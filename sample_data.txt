For the same HCA-type contracts, API scripts are currently under development.
Basic entities have been successfully extracted from the contracts.

During testing, the following issues were encountered:

IndexError: "Index 0 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 0" â€” This occurs because HCA-type contracts are structured more like tables, and while extracting and passing the data to the model, certain indexes are not being properly mapped.

BadRequestError (400): This error arises when attempting to pass the entire PDF directly to the model without chunking the content into structured text and tables.


We are actively addressing these issues by refining the extraction logic and implementing appropriate chunking strategies to ensure smooth API processing.
