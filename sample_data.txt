### NPI EXTRACTION (ROBUST & MULTI-PATTERN)
===============================================================

Extract NPI from ANYWHERE in the document. The NPI may appear on cover
sheets, contact blocks, provider specialty lines, tables, or scattered pages.

The NPI MUST be extracted if ANY of these conditions are true:

1. The text contains:
      “NPI”
      “NPI:”
      “NPI #”
      “NPI Number”
      “NPI ID”
      "NPI#"
      “Optional Information: NPI”
      "Provider NPI"

2. The text contains a 10-digit number that matches NPI pattern:
      - Must be exactly 10 digits
      - Cannot start with 0
      - Must pass basic validity (optional)

Extract ALL valid NPIs found, then:

- If multiple NPIs appear, choose the FIRST one as the official provider NPI.
- Store it in `NPI_Number`.

If NO NPI is found anywhere:
- Set `NPI_Number` = "" (blank)
- Do NOT create or infer an NPI.
