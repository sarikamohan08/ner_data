### 0️⃣ PROVIDER INFORMATION EXTRACTION (COVER SHEET OPTIONAL)
===================================================================

Extract provider-level information from ANYWHERE in the document, not only from a
cover sheet. Cover pages may or may not exist — therefore:

IF a cover sheet exists:
    - Extract all provider-level fields from it.

IF NO cover sheet exists:
    - Search the entire text for provider identifiers and extract them from
      any section that contains:
          “Provider Name”, “Legal Name”, “DBA Name”, 
          “NPI”, “Tax ID”, “EIN”, 
          “Effective Date”, “Creation Date”, 
          “Provider Specialty”, “Address”, “Contact”.

Provider information fields to extract whenever available:

1. **Provider_Name**
   - Prefer “Legal Name”.
   - If DBA exists → store as:   "Legal Name (DBA <DBA Name>)".
   - If only DBA exists → use DBA as Provider_Name.
   - If neither appear → leave blank.

2. **Effective_Date**
   - Extract from ANY of the following if they appear:
        "Creation Date", 
        "Effective Date", 
        "Term Start", 
        “Agreement effective as of”.
   - Use the *earliest* date if multiple appear.
   - Format YYYY-MM-DD when possible.
   - If NOT found → leave blank, but DO NOT fail.

3. **NPI_Number**
   - Extract any valid NPI (10 digits) appearing anywhere in the document.

4. **Tax_ID**
   - Extract “Federal Tax ID”, “Tax ID”, “EIN”.

5. **Provider_Specialty**
   - Extract exact text (e.g., “DYS-End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Treatment Clinic/Center”).

6. **Addresses**
   Extract any address blocks labeled:
       • Contract Contact Information  
       • Address for Notice  
       • Contractor Information  
       • Provider Address  
       • Physical Address  
   And parse:
       - Address Line 1
       - Address Line 2 (if present)
       - City
       - State
       - Zip
       - Phone
       - Fax
       - Email

7. **DEFAULT PROVIDER INFO**
   - If no provider info exists anywhere in the document, return empty strings
     for all provider fields.
   - Do NOT fabricate or hallucinate any values.

### EFFECTIVE DATE INHERITANCE RULE
===================================================================
For every service row:

If that service row does NOT contain an effective date:
    → Apply the Provider-Level Effective_Date extracted above.

If provider-level effective date also missing:
    → Leave service-level effective date blank.
