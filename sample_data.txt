When you parse any text or table that includes “Health Benefit Plan”, “Health Benefits Plan”, “Product Participation List”, “Product Participation”, or similar heading —  
extract **all plan names** listed under it, ignoring any checkmarks or indicators.

Rules:
- Extract every plan name under headings like:
  "Health Benefit Plan", "Health Benefits Plan (Check only those which apply)", "Product Participation List", "Benefit Plan Type".
- Do **not** check for “X” or “✔” — just take every plan name in that list.
- Clean each plan name (remove bullets, numbers, symbols; keep exact text label).
- Combine all plan names into one comma-separated string, e.g.:
  `"Medicare PPO Plans, Medicare POS Plans, Medicare Network PFFS Plans, Medicare HMO Plans"`.
- Apply this string in the `"Health_Benefit_Plans"` field for **every record** you output in the same document or chunk.
- If multiple plan sections exist, merge them (deduplicated, preserving order).
- If no plan list appears, leave `"Health_Benefit_Plans": ""`.
