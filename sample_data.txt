### AGE GROUP EXTRACTION
===============================================================

Extract the Age Group exactly as written in the text.

Age Group must ALWAYS be a TEXT FIELD.  
Do NOT convert to numbers.  
Do NOT infer any missing values.

Examples of valid Age Group patterns include (but are not limited to):
- "All Ages"
- "0–18"
- "18+"
- "21 & Under"
- "Adults"
- "Pediatric"
- "Geriatric"
- "Children"
- "0 to 99 years"
- "Age: 0-12"
- "Age Group: Adult"
- "Age Range: 18-64"

Extraction Rules:
1. Capture ANY phrase that indicates age, age range, age group, or age category.
2. Preserve the text EXACTLY as it appears in the source document.
3. If multiple age groups appear, return all separated by commas.
4. **If NO age-related text is found anywhere in the document, leave `age_group` as an empty string ("").**
