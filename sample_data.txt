1️⃣ **Provider Linkage**
- Always include the provider’s identifying information for each record:
  - Provider_Name → may appear in the text as “Provider Name”, “Legal Name”, “Doing Business As (DBA)”, “Facility Name”, or “Organization Name”.
  - Effective_Date → from phrases like “Effective Date” or “Effective”.
  - Termination_Date → from phrases like “Termination Date” or “End Date”.
  - NPI_Number → the 9- or 10-digit National Provider Identifier.
  - Tax_ID → the Tax Identification Number or EIN.
- If both “Legal Name” and “DBA” are present, store them together as:
  **“Legal Name (DBA <name>)”** in the Provider_Name field.
- If only one appears, store that as Provider_Name.
- If no provider name is found in this chunk, reuse the last seen provider details (the caller may handle continuity).
