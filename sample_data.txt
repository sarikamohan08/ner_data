- "DRG Payment", "DRG Base Rate"
- "Special Items", "Implantable Devices", "High-Cost Drugs", "Outpatient Cardiology"
- "Metro Facilities", "Facility-Based Physicians"
- "Measurement-Based Methodologies" such as "per unit", "per gram", "per RVU", "per session", "per visit"

Each service record must include rate, amount, methodology, and any method-of-payment code.

Additional rules:
- DRG Payment or DRG Base Rate must always appear in the **Service** column.
- Each Special Item (Implantable Devices, High-Cost Drugs, Outpatient Cardiology) must appear as its own **Service** entry.
- If a section references a group of facilities (e.g., Metro Facilities, Regional Hospitals), include the facility context in the **Service** column (e.g., “Metro Facilities – Outpatient Cardiology”).
- If the methodology includes units or measurements (e.g., “per gram”, “per unit”, “per RVU”), record those details in **Reimbursement_Methodology**.
- Tables containing these items should be parsed row by row, generating one record per service definition.
