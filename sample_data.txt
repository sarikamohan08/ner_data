### REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY EXTRACTION (UPDATED)
===================================================================

- **Reimbursement_Methodology**
  - Extract how reimbursement is calculated for each service, whether it appears in **text paragraphs or tables**.

  - Common valid values (case-insensitive, normalize capitalization):
    • "Per Diem"
    • "Per Procedure"
    • "Per Visit"
    • "Per Case"
    • "Percent of Charge" / "Percentage of Charges"
    • "Medicare Allowable Amount"
    • "Fixed Rate" / "All Fixed Rates"
    • "Fee Schedule"
    • "Percent of Line Charge"
    • "POC" (Plan of Care)
    • "Per Claim"
    • "Per Occurrence"
    • "Per Member Per Month"
    • "Percent of Allowed"
    • "Capitation"

  - **Extraction Rules:**
    1. Search both **paragraph text** and **tables** in the same context where the service, code, or reimbursement rate appears.
       - If the table column header or nearby text includes "Methodology", "Basis", "Payment Type", or "Reimbursement Type", extract the value under that column.
       - If a methodology word (e.g., "Per Diem") appears in a rate or service description, capture it from the text.
    2. Normalize the extracted phrase to title case (e.g., “Percent of Charge” not “percent of charge”).
    3. If multiple methodology types are mentioned (e.g., “Per Diem and Fee Schedule”), include both separated by commas.
    4. If no methodology appears in text or tables, leave `"Reimbursement_Methodology": ""`.

  - **In tables:**
    - Look for headers like “Methodology”, “Payment Type”, “Basis”, “Reimb Type”, “Payment Method”.
    - Extract the corresponding cell values (e.g., “Per Diem”, “Fee Schedule”, “Percent of Charge”).
    - Associate each extracted value with the correct service in the same table row.

  - **In text:**
    - Detect phrases like:
      - “reimbursed on a per diem basis”
      - “payment per case”
      - “percent of charge”
      - “according to the Fee Schedule”
      - “Medicare allowable amount applies”
      - “fixed rate reimbursement”
      - “per visit basis”
      - “based on percent of line charge”
      - “POC basis”
    - Extract and normalize as above.

  - **If found both in table and paragraph:**
    - Use the most specific one (the table cell value takes priority).
    - If both differ, include both (comma-separated).

  - **Output Rule:**
    - Include `"Reimbursement_Methodology"` in every JSON record for that service, populated with all relevant values.
